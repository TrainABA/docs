# docs
This is the official online documentation for TrainABA. Started in 2017 October, TrainABA has a lot of material and the docs may get messy in the process of organizing the overall project. The code here contains ReadTheDocs rst files, licensed GPLv3.

## Plans
B.T. (founder/workhorse) finished his school program recently and has been completing projects rapidly to make up for lost time. The goal for TrainABA is to make it a free and open source software project that can help ABA programmers (trainers, supervisors, learners, technicians, but probably not computer code programmers) build their professional development (training) materials around a framework they can take across companies, platforms, universities, etc. B.T. thinks the credentialing board should do this kind of thing but they are going a different direction. As a result, TrainABA was built as a framework for supervisors/professors to build staff/student training programs.

## Projects
TrainABA books were released in 2015 December 31. He is building Moodle courses on a hosted platform as of October 11, 2017, having stepped into release v1.1.0 of a Segments course for supervisors. B.T. knows how to use these materials, but most people do not. This documentation will serve as a bridge to bring all the TrainABA goodies together with documentation and instructions. This includes the books, LMS courses, SAFMED app, growing video library, audio collection, many hidden things that have not been released yet, and guidelines to tracking supervision using ubiquitous tools. 

If we do this right, everybody can use this stuff and we can share with each other. Licenses will protect the work, keeping creative material intact/credited while generalizable knowledge will remain free.

If we do this wrong, people will think TrainABA is three paperbacks and some seminars B.T. ran in 2014.
